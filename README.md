Shoutcast/Icecast streaming interface using Pure Data

This patch was last used on a PowerMac G5 in 2010, I've done a little bit of work to make it load in [PD-Next](https://github.com/sebshader/pdnext), but it likely needs more work to function correctly. Requires ceammc, zexy, cyclone, unauthorized, ggee, and moonlib.

Currently calling out to the perl scripts does not work as there is no working "shell" or "exec" in PD-Next on Windows 10.

This patch *does not work* in Purr Data or Pd-L2Ork and no support will be provided for those platforms.
